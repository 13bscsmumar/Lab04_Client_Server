Introduction:
In this lab I’ve implemented a simple client server in python that can actually store Notes of the users against their name, also it give an option for user to search the note by providing the username.
How to Run: 
Open “Server.py” and “Client.py” in any python IDE, Python IDLE is preferred. First run the “Server.py” code. It should say “The server is ready to serve”, then run the “Client.py” and choose an option from the menu. 
As I’ve stored the records in a list named storage, therefore it is necessary that after adding the records, you should NOT close the shell or python window in-order to perform a search function.
